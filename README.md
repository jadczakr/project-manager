# project-manager

Hello

As in commit, this is my project to work.

This is order manager. It has important function - reminder :) . At my work a lot of people can just forget about daily-routine obligations. This application helps us to DONT FORGET! :)

Usage:
  - creat order and select routine ( 1 per day/1 per week/1 per month/1 per year/ some selected days of week etc. ) 
  - select the contractor of making order and his assistant ( if main contractor isn't working ) 
  - select the vacation ( then order is showing at assistant's panel ) 
  - select the status of order ( accepted / done / cancelled / denied )
